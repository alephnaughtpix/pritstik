    we only lasted one and a half years in realtime but we will last forever thanx 
    to the world of the internet in the far future when machine intelligence has 
    triumphed over humankind datafiles of <em>pritstik</em> 
    will be a part of computers stortage space in the say way that humans listen 
    to birdsong because lets face it just as humans will find it hard emulate 
    birdsong computers will have trouble emulating the uniquely human <a href="{{ page.music_index | relative_url }}">musical 
    experience</a> of <em>pritstik</em> perhaps in 
    the near furture archeologistics will unearth <a href="{{ page.cd_index | relative_url }}">our 
    CD</a> and realise it is an artifact of unique cultural significance 
    either that or a funny circular plastic thingy in the meantime historians 
    will be able to tell their grandchildren of the exploits of this truly geat 
    underground group and its record company <a href="{{ page.mrr_index | relative_url }}" target=""><em>michael
