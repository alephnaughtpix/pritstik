<h1 class="subnav"><a href="index.html">bio</a> | recording infos</h1>
      <p>Here's a quick rundown on the various recording methods we used in our 
        groundbreaking album!!! </p>
      <h2 class="subheading"><a name="Studios"></a>studios</h2>
      <p>We used 4 tape recorders in various songs. The first one, used in the 
        majority of songs was an Amstrad cassette recorder, (called "<em>MF</em>"!!) 
        with the erase head turned permantently off!! The second was a mono Binatone 
        portable tape recorder!!! (Called "<em>Monotone</em>"!!) 
        The third was a most sophisticated Sony tape recorder, (Called "<em>M8</em>"!!!) 
        where we could turn the erase head on and off!!! And the fourth and final 
        one was a really swish Teac model (called "<em>DJ</em>"!!!) 
        where we could mix in audio input and microphones in realtime!!! </p>
      <p>So there are 5 types of recording setup used here: </p>
      <table class="info-table">
        <tr> 
          <td>setup 1</td>
          <td>"MF" used with two microphones (used for most of the 1986 recordings)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>setup 2</td>
          <td> "Monotone" using one mic, then fiddled about with on "M8". (Some 
            of the 1986 stuff)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>setup 3</td>
          <td>"MF" used with a pair of old headphones used as stereo mics!! (used 
            for most of the 1987 recordings) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>setup 4</td>
          <td>Stuff recorded on "M8" (Some 1987 stuff)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            any guitar you've ever heard!!! </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>drums</td>
          <td>the cheapest drums ever to make such a big drum sound!! bet Phil 
            Collins couldn't make such a great sound with cardboard boxes for 
            drums and biros for drumsticks!!!! </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&quot;grunge&quot; vocoder</td>
          <td>for the song &quot;<a href="{{ "/music/songs/cat.html" | relative_url }}">cat</a>&quot;, 
            PritStik invented a completely new instrument!!!! this special &quot;grunge&quot; 
            vocoder was made from one of those mini-headphones you used to get 
            on personal hifi's before the electrix ear-plugs came into vogue!! 
            We used the left headphone as a vocoder "transducer", and it gave 
            that special "grungy" vocoder effect you get in old Kraftwerk records!!!! 
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h2 class="subheading"><a name="Style"></a>production style</h2>
      <p>we really liked a lot of those old 60s records where loads of the stuff 
        was in the left channel and all the other stuff was in the right hand 
        channel!!! So most of our recordings are produced in that very style!!!! 
      </p>
      <p>We also recorded nearly everything using microphones, even the electronic 
        instruments, so we could get that authentic "live" sound! And we used 
        different types of mics to get different sounds!!!! We even used old audio 
        headphones and personal stereo headphones as mics!!!! </p>
      <p>Even though we used "old-style" recording techniques and instruments, 
        we still used up-to-date equipment like the VL-Tone and samplers!!! And 
        we also pushed our analogue tape recorders to their limits in re-inventing 
        the recording process as we went along!!! </p>
