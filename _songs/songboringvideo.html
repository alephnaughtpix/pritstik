<p>It's a very boring song for a very boring video. <br>
        Michael is yawning, so it must be very boring. <br>
        Dad is sleeping, so it must be very boring. <br>
        Mum is watching it, so it must be very boring. <br>
        It's a very boring song for a very boring video. </p> 
      <p>It's very boring! </p>

<p>This is one of the most epic productions we've ever been involved in, 
        thanks to our involvement with Mnemonic, who like to do big productions!</p>
      <p>The original instrumental track was recorded on "<a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">DJ</a>" 
        using the <a href="{{ page.instruments_link | relative_url }}">VSS100</a>. Then 
        it was given to Mnemonic who added a few effects to it using "<a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">M8</a>" 
        and the sampler!! </p>
      <p>Then we recorded that version back onto "DJ", mixing in the mic input, 
        allowing us to sing, and play guitar and tin whistle over it!!! Then finally, 
        Mnemonic took that recording and added more stuff to using "M8" and the 
        sampler, including the massive ending sequence with all those sound effects!!!!!</p> 
      <p>Apparently the end bit with the thunderstorm and the helicopter is partly 
        inspired by a Steve Miller record!!!!!! Don't ask me what one tho... </p>
