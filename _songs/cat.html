<p>I was having a stroll...<br>
    Look! Stay still!! <br>
    Look up there!! <br>
    It's a juicy little fieldmouse!!! <br>
    Lovely and juicy and plump!!!<br>
    Pounce!! Then I run... </p>

<p>This is one of two experimental "acapella" recordings we did in 1986!!! 
    When we say "acapella", what we really mean is one voice, and another 
    voice through a "<a href="{{ page.instruments_link | relative_url }}">vocoder</a>"!!!!!! </p>
  <p>The vocoder was made from one of those mini-headphones you used to get 
    on personal hifi's before the electrix ear-plugs came into vogue!! We 
    used the left headphone as a vocoder "transducer", and it gave that special 
    "grungy" vocoder effect you get in old Kraftwerk records!!!! This revolutionary 
    technique was recorded in 1986 on <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">Setup 
    1</a>!!!</p> 
  <p>This song was written by PritStik Mej, based on one of her adventures 
    in "modern poetry" at school!!! She starts to sing Cliff Richard's "Living 
    Doll" at the end, but we quickly fade off before she can break any copyrights!!!!! </p>
