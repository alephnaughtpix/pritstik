<p>This was a really experimental track!!! PritStik Mej played the guitar, 
  and we just made up words as we went along!!!! And we came up with this 
  mega "Bohemian Rhapsody" style epic, which includes a tribute to the Beatles 
  "A Day in the Life" in the middle, and Krafwerk's "Spule 4" at the start!!!!! </p>
<p>The original track was recorded in 1986 using "<a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">MonoTone</a>", 
  and then redubbed into stereo with a 50s style "echo" effect!!! As with 
  "<a href="wegottapausebutton.html">We've 
  Gotta Pause Button...</a>", we've taken the original mono recording 
  and remastered it into stereo for a clearer sounding recording, so you 
  can hear the full majesty of this epic!!!!! </p>
