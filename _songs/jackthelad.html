<p>The original mix was done on <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">Setup 
  3</a> as a indie-dance instrumental partly inspired by Pop Will Eat Itself, 
  and Steve Silk Hurley's "Jack Your Body", which was the first major House 
  music hit in the UK!!! The bits with the voices, guitars and drum machines 
  are part of the first mix!!!!  </p>
<p>Then we worked with Mnemonic on a remix on <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">Setup 
  4</a>, and a whole load of extra sampler effects were added! The tune's 
  basically the same tho. Also, check out the "radio" bit at the end- we 
  thought it was really cool!!! </p>
