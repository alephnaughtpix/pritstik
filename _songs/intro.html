{% capture info %}
<p>believe it or not, the words which make up this momentous introduction 
        were recorded in early 1987 on <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">setup 
        3</a>!!! even then we knew that this would end up on cd one day, and here 
        it is!!! this uses the <a href="{{ page.instruments_link | relative_url }}">vss100</a> 
        to make a momentous chord, and then an angels chorus!! (and believe it 
        or not, it's actually the "duhhh!!!" sample from the next track speeded 
        up!!!) the echoes use the sampler and loads of dubbing...</p>
