{% capture info %}
<p>This is a strange one, as it was done in two parts!!! The second part 
  you hear is the "original" song recorded on <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">setup 
  3</a>, which only lasted a short time as we got bored with it!! Then we 
  made another bit on the same setup, which you hear at the start, which 
  was meant to make it sound like a "12-inch"!!!!  </p>
<p>We used the <a href="{{ page.instruments_link | relative_url }}">vss100</a> sampler 
  a lot in this one, especially the "12-inch" bit!! </p>
