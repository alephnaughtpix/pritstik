<p>I think that Mum is a big fat bum, I think that Dad is very mad, because 
  they don't like PritStik, ooboopidoo, PritStik, ooboopidoo, PritStik, 
  ooboopidoo, PritStik!!!!!</p>
<p>I think that Mum is very dumb, I think that Dad is very bad, because 
  they don't like PritStik, ooboopidoo, PritStik, ooboopidoo, PritStik, 
  ooboopidoo, PritStik!!!!!</p>

<p>This was a real rebel song!!! In fact, it was so rebellious, we originally 
  wrote the lyrics on toilet paper!!! 
<p>This one featured the <a href="{{ page.instruments_link | relative_url }}">vss100 
  sampler</a> with a voice going "doo!" in a march rhythm!!! It also has 
  a couple of killer keyboard solos, including a rare one by PritStik Mej!! 
  In fact, you can here PritStik Mik saying "You want to do a solo?" and 
  PritStik Mej says "Yes!"!!!!!! 
<p>The sampler was also used to add the echos and various effects using 
  <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">setup 3</a>, including the classic 
  end bit where the vocals are "morphed" in guitar sounds!!!!!
