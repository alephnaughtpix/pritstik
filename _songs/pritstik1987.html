<p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik!</p>
<p>I hate chess pieces because I keep standing on them. </p>
<p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! </p>
<p><em>I went down to the shops to get some PritStik, but while I was looking for it, the other man was stuck!</em></p>
<p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! </p>
<p>Drum solo! </p>
<p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! </p>
<p>I make up any old words. I make them up even though they sound ridiculous. </p>
<p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! </p>
<p>Guitar solo! </p>
<p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! </p>
<p><em>Rollerboots keep going over my toes and they stay because they're... </em></p>
<p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! </p>
<p>Can you say anything? No, you're stuck for words, ah ha ha ha! </p>
<p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! (Ad lib to fade) </p>

      <p>This is a bit more sedate than "<a href="pritstik1986.html">PritStik 
        (1986)</a>" because we used a laid-back "Reggae" rhythm on this 
        version recorded on <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">setup 
        3</a>. But there's more to this one in production terms!!! The main track 
        involves PritStik performing, the organ on the <a href="{{ page.instruments_link | relative_url }}">vss100</a>, 
        a harmonic "duuuhh!" on the sampler, and a really space-age synth sound!!! 
        Then in further overdubs, the sampler was used to add backing vocals, 
        some echo FX, accentuate the drum solo, and add the guitar solo!!! (Yes, 
        you read that right!!! It wasn't a real guitar!!! It was actually a sample!!!!) </p>
      <p>This track when released on mp3.com on April 2000, shortly afterwards 
        got to no. 1 in the Glasgow charts and no. 3 in the reggae charts, just 
        behind Bob Marley and Pato Banton!! </p>

      <p>Some bloke from a hip band in Chicago called Scope Creep said on his 
        "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020321094547/http://www.theworstoftheworst.com/">Worst of the Worst</a>" 
        page: </p>
        <blockquote>"Torture Factor = 9 Complete musical incompetence 
        is not found solely in America . Here we have our first piece from Strathclyde, 
        Scotland. The Scots can obviously hold their own against the very worst 
        of American culture. The vocals sound like Steven Hawking singing through 
        a distortion pedal right before he completely lost his voice. Don't ask 
        me what instruments are in this because I just don't know. It could be 
        a keyboard or maybe just a bunch of chairs, cats and decomposing human 
        remains being beaten with sticks. I'll leave it up to you to decide."

      <p>Comments on the review!!</p> 
      <ol>
        <li class="smaller">"This is a absolute brilliant concept you got there. 
          [...] I have never had such a good laugh in months. Especially this 
          ?Reggae Song?." </li>
        <li class="smaller"> "The sh*t about Stephen Hawking singing through a 
          distortion pedal is classic."</li>
        <li class="smaller">"all these "gifted" individuals are advertising they 
          got #1 or #3 on a particular genre." </li>
        <li class="smaller">"i love the desc. of pristek so fitting. bodies being 
          beaten with sticks hilarious!"</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>IMPORTANT NOTE</em>- 
        PritStik have never beaten cats or decomposing human remains with sticks 
        in pursuit of their individual vision of musical expression. </p>
