<p>Baby love <br>
  Baby me <br>
  Baby falls off a tree <br>
  Baby dum <br>
  Baby bum <br>
  Baby smells so much it hums </p>
<p>Baby sings <br>
  Baby argh! <br>
  Baby you know he can't sing <br>
  Baby oh <br>
  Baby bum <br>
  Baby I can't think of anything.</p> 
<p>Baby Why <br>
  Baby I <br>
  Baby don't know why I keep saying "Baby" <br>
  Baby I <br>
  Baby really <br>
  Baby hate this so there. </p>
<p>Baby end. </p>

{% capture info %}
<p><p>The basic song was partly inspired by a jam with Mnemonic, but only we 
  actually completed the song!!!!! We did an early version in 1986, with 
  just 3 verses instead of the 6 that are in this 1987 version!!!  </p>
<p>This might sound different to some of the other <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">Setup 
  3</a> recordings... This was because it wasn't recorded in an open room, 
  but in a very big cardboard box!!!! It certainly gives the VSS100 sound 
  a particular bite!! Of course, it can also get cramped in there, as you 
  can hear from the noises at the end of the track!!!!!! </p>
