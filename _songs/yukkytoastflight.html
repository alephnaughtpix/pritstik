<p>There's toast flying about, and there's some much steam from the kettle, 
        that I can't see, and get hit by flying toast, so I get dead angry, so 
        there!!! Okey yah??!?! </p>
      <p>Here we go!!! 5, 9, 3, 8 ... Erm, something else. Yeah!!! </p>
      <p>Theres so much toast because of the new toaster and it always burns the 
        toast if you don't watch it!!! There's so much steam because of the new 
        kettle!!!! Okey yah?!?!?! </p>
      <p>Here we go!!! 5, 4, 3, 6 ... Erm. Yeah!!! </p>
      <p>I hate toast if it's burnt, and if it flies in my face. I hate the kettle 
        steaming up the kitchen. I get amazingly extremely mad!!!! Okey yah?!?!? </p>
      <p>Here we go!!! 2.3456... Erm!!!! Yeah!!!! </p>
      <p>(But anyway I am already mad so what difference does it make? OK!! Yeah!!!) </p>

<p>This is our searing endictment of the empty capitalistic materialism 
        of the Yuppy Decade!!!!! And it also about the time our parents got a 
        new kettle and toaster- at the same time!!!!!!!! </p>
      <p>We were really adventurous with this <a href="/info/recording.html#Studios">setup 
        3</a> recording, as not only did we have the <a href="/info/recording.html#Instruments">VSS100</a> 
        going on all four cylinders, but we were also playing the guitar and tin 
        whistle as well!!!! </p>
      <p>There was a slight problem halfway through the second verse, as we were 
        interrupted whilst singing it and put off completely!!! We still played 
        anyway, and recovered by the third verse!!!! The missing words were overdubbed 
        by PritStik Mik later... The overdubs also included the voice yelling 
        "Toast!!!" and "The Noize!!!"!!!! </p>
      <p>You can hear us being really ironic at the end as we shout "Rubbish!! 
        Rubbish!!! Absolute rubbish!!!" We were of course joking!!! </p>
