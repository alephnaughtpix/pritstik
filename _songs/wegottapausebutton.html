<p>This 
        marvel of modern recording was recorded on the <a href="/info/recording.html#Studios">Binatone</a>, 
        with PritStik Mik singing and pressing the pause button squillions of 
        times!!! The mono recording was then overdubbed into stereo, to get that 
        special "stereo echo" effect!!! </p>
      <p>We've actually remastered the original mono recording this track into 
        stereo using the same techniques, so you can hear this ground-breaking 
        recording in even higher quality than it was before!!!! </p>
      <p>The name of the track is of course a tribute to the seminal 80s indie 
        band <font color="#ff0000" class="red">We've Got A Fuzzbox, And We're 
        Going To Use It! </font></p>
