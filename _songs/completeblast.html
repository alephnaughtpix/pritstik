<p>This 
        is a really experimental one!!! It's an instrumental recorded on <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">setup 
        4</a> featuring the Casio VL-Tone during a funky programmed sequence, 
        and three accoustic guitars!!! </p>
      <p>In the first part the guitars do "improvisation", then in the second 
        part, they do a really cool riff!!! </p>
      <p>For some reason there's some wacky recording at the end, going backwards!!!!! 
        We think it might be Betty Boo, but we're not sure!! </p>
