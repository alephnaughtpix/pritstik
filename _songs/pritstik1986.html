     <p>PritStik! 
        PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! 
      <p>I hate chess pieces because I keep standing on them. </p>
      <p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik!  </p>
      <p>(Now Mary's going to tell us what happened to her down the shops...)  </p>
      <p class="red"><font color="#FF0000">One day I went down to the shops!!! 
        To get some PritStik!!! But while I was looking for it, there was this 
        other man!!!! And he was really stuck!!!! </font> </p>
      <p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik!  </p>
      <p>Drum solo!  </p>
      <p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik!  </p>
      <p>I make up any old words. I make them up even though they sound ridiculous.  </p>
      <p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik!  </p>
      <p>Drum Solo! <i>[Guitar solo] </i> </p>
      <p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik!  </p>
      <p class="red"><font color="#FF0000">Yes and my feet are getting rather 
        sticky, because they're... </font> </p>
      <p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik!  </p>
      <p>Can you say anything? No, you're stuck for words, ah ha ha ha!  </p>
      <p>PritStik! PritStik! PritStik! PritStik!  </p>
      <p>(Ad lib to fade)  </p>

      <p><p>This is the earliest PritStik recording that survives to this day!!!! 
        And it's the earliest version of our theme song!!! Technically it should 
        be called "PritStik (1986 B)", but we lost the original "1986 A" recording!!!! 
        (Sniff sniff!!!)  </p>
      <p>Anyway, you can hear the amazing energy of our early <a href="/info/recording.html#Studios">setup 
        1</a> recordings on this rare gem!!! Believe it or not, the only overdubs 
        are the drum solos and the extra guitars near the end!!! The rest was 
        recorded live with one microphone strapped to PritStik Mik's funky <a href="/info/recording.html#Instruments">Casio 
        VL-Tone</a>, and the other capturing PritStik Mej's energetic drumming, 
        and PritStik's unbridled vocal style!!!!  </p>
      <p>In fact, it's so unbridled that at one point PritStik Mik announces the 
        "drum solo" when he really means the "guitar solo"!!!! And believe it 
        or not, the "guitar solo" is not really done by a guitar here either!!! 
        It's PritStik Mik through a <a href="/info/recording.html#Instruments">vocoder</a>!!!!!! 
        Also listen out for a radio being tuned halfway through the drum solo!!!! 
      <p>That's the kind of wacky off the wall people we are!!!! </p>
