      <p>I is a punk!!! You is a punk!!! You ain't a punk!!! Anyone is a punk

<p> <p>We did a version of this in 1986, which was fairly sedate, and used the 
        VL-Tone and a couple of tin whistles!!!!! So when we came to do this version 
        in 1987 on <a href="{{ page.studio_link | relative_url }}">setup 3</a>, we wanted 
        it to be a bit more energetic!!!! </p>
      <p>We also wanted to use a guitar, but we didn't have a proper "punk" guitar, 
        so PritStik Mik made a guitar noise using his "<a href="{{ page.instruments_link | relative_url }}">vocoder</a>", 
        with loads of feedback, then sampled it and used it on the <a href="{{ page.instruments_link | relative_url }}">VSS100</a> 
        in hyperspeed mode, and hey presto- punk!!! </p>
      <p>Add to that PritStik Mej on the tin whistle adding some extra "feedback", 
        and you have the perfect setting for our classic punky lyrics!! (BTW Hope 
        you like the "Granny Bates" joke!!!! We certainly fell about on the floor 
        when we wrote it!!!!!)
